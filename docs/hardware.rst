Hardware
========

edi is a generic tool that does not come with support for a specific hardware.

However, there are several reference project configurations that you can use as a starting point
for your own project:

- Raspberry Pi: `https://github.com/lueschem/edi-pi`_
- Compulab IoT Gateway: `https://github.com/lueschem/edi-cl`_
- Variscite System on Module: `https://github.com/lueschem/edi-var`_

You can also fork and adjust one of the above configurations for your custom board.
